Additional Project Information:

1. I was stuck for a long time trying to figure out why I wasn't able to
   access my shared memory array that I wrote the pos or neg numbers (prime 
   or not) to from my Control.c and I finally realized it was because I was
   detaching and removing the shared memory from ChildProcess.c...I changed
   it to only detach and not remove until the entire program finishes.
2. Everything seems to be working according to the project description 
   based on my testing.
