How to Compile and Run (without typing "./" before the executable):

$ make
$ export PATH="$PATH:."
$ bt [-h] [-L -d -g -i -p -s -t -u | -l] [dirname]

To remove all .o and the bt executable:

$ make clean

Additional Project Information:

1. In SearchFileSystem.c I added code to ignore the .git files because they
   were printing lots of additional files and directories when there was no
   directory specified. It works with the .git files but excluding those makes it much
   easier to see that the Breadth-First Traversal is working correctly.
2. I included following and printing the symbolic links in SearchFileSystem.c
   because I was able to format it to be after the file path/name similar
   to how ls -l formats following the symbolic link
3. I was able to make it so make clean will remove all executables at the current
   level using find. That way if the executable name is changed after compilation
   "make clean" command will still remove the newly named executable.
4. I started small on this project and slowly built up trying to get everything
   that I added to work together. I had to move code around to different locations
   so that it would work together and for clean up purposes. The toughest part was
   getting the breadth-first search to work with a queue which I implemented after
   I finished everything else except the symbolic link option. Overall, I think
   everything should be working according to the assignment sheet.
