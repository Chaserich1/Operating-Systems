How to Compile and Run (without typing "./" before the executable):

$ make
$ export PATH="$PATH:."

To Run (Default option values or using options):

$ ./oss 
or
$ ./oss -n 18

To remove all .o, .dat and the executables:

$ make clean

Aging Algorithm Comments:

At the beginning of the while loop in oss.c, before creating a new process, it
checks to ensure that no processes are starved for CPU time. If a process is 
starved and the wait time is significantly more than the cpu time then the process 
is moved to the highest priority of its class. If it is a user process then its pr
iority becomes 1, so it is marked as the highest priority of the user processes.

Additional Project Information:

I made it so once a process completes then the "fake" pid is made available 
again for use by other processes, so you will see the same pid number mult
times. Further in the output file you will see nearly all of the available pids used.
Also for writing to the file I made it so if it goes past 9950 lines
then it will stop generating new processes but it will still finish out what
is in the system, so it may go a bit over 10000 as it's finishing but it will
not go significantly over. Make clean removes the output log file as well.
